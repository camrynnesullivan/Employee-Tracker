# Employee Tracker

I created an app that tracks the employees of a company. It allows you to View All Employees, View All Roles, View All Departments, Add Employees, Add Roles, Add Departments, and Update the Roles of Employees if they get a promotion. I struggled with being able to update the role of employees but managed to get their role and then select the employee to start the update process.
